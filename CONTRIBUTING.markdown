## Subsection in README

Humans recognize patterns very efficiently, so if all templates listed follow a common structure, 
it is less mental overhead to _browse_ a long list of templates.


The suggested structure is:

    ## template (group) title
    
    * link to template
    * link to variant of template
    * link to another variant of template
    * ...

    ### Features
    
    #### a subsection for the distinctive features of every template variant

    * Some feature ...

    ### Build Commands and Flags
    
    * describe a notable build command or build flag:
    
         example command, e.g.: stack build -f projectname:someflag 

    #### optional subsections for template variant specific commands

    ### Source Directories
    
            ... directory structure of source files
            
    #### optional subsections for template variant specific directories
